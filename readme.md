# Bongóblíða weather website

I live in Iceland, where the winters are long and the summers are short. The Icelanders have a special word for good summer weather: bongóblíða. I am making a website that shows people whether it is currently bongóblíða in Reykjavík, the country's capital.  
I am using the weather data from the openweathermap.org API. The webpage will state that it is bongóblíða if the temperature is 15 degrees Celsius or higher, the weather description is not equal to 'Rain' and the percentage of clouds is equal to or less than 50%. Since temperatures over 20 degrees Celsius are rare in Iceland, one can't be too strict. :)  
Of course most of the time the website will show that it isn't bongóblíða, in which case it has a button that people can click to get ideas for what to do in this 'bad' weather ;)  
I removed my API-key from the code, because with my free account I can only do a limited number of calls. However, you can easily create your own free account on openweathermap.org.  
When I have put the website online, I will share the link here.
